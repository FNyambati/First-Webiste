             <h1> My Journey to Utah</h1>

            <p>From Noob to Bootcamp Student</p>
        </div>
         <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My full name is Fred Nyambati and I'm 20 years old, I'm coming to DevMountain from Maryland, where I was a student. Things I like to do are coding(obviously), watching and playing football, and anything to do with Boston sports.</p>
         <h2>Why Programming?</h2>

        <p>I tried programming on a online <a href="https://code.org/">game</a> that I had fun using, mind you, I have never coded in my life. I wanted to learn more so I started to take classes at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn"> codecademy </a> I took a HTML and CSS and enjoyed it. I read on Quora that Javascript is a great language to learn so I went with it and took the Javascript course. I enjoyed that too. I wondered to myself if I wanted to make a career out of it. After another javascript course on <a href="https://wwww.codeschool.com">CodeSchool</a> my fate was sealed.</p>
         <h2>Why a Bootcamp???</h2>

        <p>Before I get to my selection process I want to briefly explain why I decided to attend a bootcamp instead of just getting a computer science degree. Before I comitted to bootcamps I had been a biology major looking to become a pharmacist. I enjoyed it but I actually had fun coding. I didnt want to change majors and take on thousands of dollars in additional student loan debt, so I realized that bootcamps would make the most sense.</p>
         <h2>What I wanted out of a bootcamp</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="mean.io">MEAN</a> stack</li>
            <li> A Great Hiring Rate </li>
            <li> A Great Value </li>
            <li> Great Program and Instructors </li>
            <li>Beginner Friendly and can help you develop</li>
            <li>Location, Location, Location</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Bootcamp Search</h2>
          <p>Considering my expectations of a bootcamp Im going to make a list of all the bootcamps I considered in order of my preferred pick down to the ones I used as a last resort</p>
          <ol>
            <li><a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/">HackReactor</a>
            <li><a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy</a>
            <li><a href="http://www.makersquare.com/">MakerSquare</a>
            <li><a href="http://www.appacademy.io/">AppAcademy</a>
            <li><a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">DevBootcamp</a>
            <li><a href="https://devmounta.in/">DevMountain</a>
            <li><a href="http://www.thesoftwareguild.com/">The Software Guild</a>
            <li><a href="https://www.codercamps.com/home/index">Coder Camps</a>
            <li><a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>
            <li>Online alternatives <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/">The Viking School</a> and <a href="https://www.bloc.io/">Bloc</a>
          </ol>
          <h2>Narrowing It Down</h2>
          <p> Right off the bat I wanted to learn the MEAN stack, so App Academy, Devbootcamp, Epicodus, and The Software guld were out. Next, I didnt trust myself learning online in a immersive enviroment so Bloc and Viking School were out. I wanted a beginner friendly bootcamp, so HackReactor was out. They preach they go from 20-120, but most of their students are already developers and I feel that it is elitist now. Value was big for me so Fullstack was out, even though it was an amazing school. But $17,000 was too much for me. That Leaves Coder Camps and DevMountain. I decided to choose Coder Camps due to the SF location. After going through the application and pre work, I got cold feet about the program and results, with the help of a DevMountain student, I decided to shift to DevMountain. It had a great value, proven program, the mountains are beautiful, and it isn't elitist. at the same time they are selective of their students. Unlike Coder Camps, who let me in without having a proper coding challenge.</p>
          <h2>Preparing Myself and Expectations</h2>
            <p>DevMountain is a great program so I wanted to make sure my skill are up to par, I recieved the the book <a href="http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/"> "A smarter way to learn Javascript"</a>. It was a great book and I highly recommend it, they also gave some resources to further my skills. I also wanted to make my on website as practice, which is what I'm doing now! I feel like Im as ready as I'll ever be and I am extremely excited. My expectations out of the course is to learn as much as I can and network with my classmates and instructors. I also plan on using my newly aquired skills to land a job as a web developer, software developer, software engineer, etc.
            I leave in one week, and my journey to Utah will finally begin. </p>
