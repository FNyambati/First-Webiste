     <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div class="about">
        <p>I'm a 20 year-old aspiring Web Developer from Baltimore, Maryland. I began to code about 3 months ago. Before I comitted myself to coding, I was a college student studying Biology. I enjoyed the lab setting a lot, but when I started to code.</p>
        <p>It intrested me, as I kept dabbling I began to love it. I wanted to make a career out of it but I didn't want to change my major and spend thousands of dollars on top of what I already owe in student Loans. Thats when I stumbled upon programming bootcamps.</p>
    </div>
     <h2>My Bootcamp search</h2>

    <div class="search">
        <p>When I started my Bootcamp search, the very first bootcamp I came across was <a href "http://hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a>. I only found it because a youtube <a href "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI6A1WIJJRg">video</a> was the first result to pop-up. Looking back at it, these bootcamps are amazing at marketing.</p>
        <p>They have the same trend of throwing out graduate salaries, even though most are in San Francisco and New York, where the cost of living makes that very average unless you live by yourself, but hey, hindsight is 20/20.</p>
        <p>I found a bootcamp in Oakland called Coder Camps. I Liked the program so I applied, I got in and was about a month from enrolling, financial problems came up with financing the camp that forced me to drop out. that was for the best because I started to develop cold feet.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Maybe it was for the best....</p>
     <h2>How I found DevMountain</h2>

    <div class="dev">
        <p>I should've added before I even applied to coder camps, I took a precourse with Telegraph Prep that prepares you for the challenging technical interviews that you will face with most 5-star Bootcamps.</p>
        <p>During that I got to meet a classmate of mine that was very intrested in DevMountain. He ended up enrolling in DevMountain's Dallas. What set DevMountain apart was definitely the affordability. It was $8,900 total compared to Coder Camps' $13,600. Another advantage was the free housing.</p>
        <p>In Fact, the only things I am paying for are my plane ticket, food, and the Uber ride to the apartment from the airport. So when I begin class, all that I'll need is a attitude ready to learn and begin my journey into being a Software developer.</p>
    </div>
     <h2>What I want to get out of the program</h2>

    <div class="wants">
        <p>I want to learn as much as I can while I'm here. I want to use this bootcamp as a launchpad for my career. More reasons for picking Dev mountain, I wanted to learn Javascript because of its versatility. Dev Mountain does the MEAN stack of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js.</p>
        <p>But the part that sealed the deal. I took a look at pictures of the campus and surroundings, Provo is just beautiful to look at. So I'm extremely confident I made the right choice!</p>
    </div>
     <h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>

    <div class="goals">
        <p>As far as goals go in the short term, I would like to learn as much as I can and get the portfolio to land a job as a Software Developer/Engineer. I'd like to specialize in Node or Angular. As far as a company, Id like to work for a larger comapany to start, but I wouldn't mind using my talents at a startup.</p>
        <p>Long-term I would love to pursue entrepenurship while I'm still in my youth. Start a buisness, or maybe create a app.(Maybe learn how to do that in Dev Mountains IOS course!). I would love to start my career in the west coast, Seattle, maybe the Bay Area. But my heart is definitely in Los Angeles as a dream city to live in!</p>
